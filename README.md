## 🎯 What's This?

This is **Sajad's digital playground** — a space where experiments happen, ideas get tested, and minds get blown. No rules, no limits, just pure creative chaos turned into code.

## 🚀 What You'll Find Here

- 💡 **Experimental Projects** - Wild ideas that somehow work
- 🎨 **Creative Coding** - Art meets algorithms
- 🧪 **Tech Experiments** - Breaking things to learn how they work
- 🎭 **Interactive Experiences** - Click around and be surprised
- 🌊 **Flow State Creations** - Built when inspiration strikes

## 🛠️ The Lab

This playground is built with whatever tool fits the vision. Could be vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, could be the latest framework, could be something I invented last Tuesday. The point isn't the tech stack — it's the **experience**.

## 🎪 Current Experiments

> *Check back soon — the first mind-blowing experiment is being cooked up...*

## 📡 Connect

Want to see what happens when creativity meets code? You're in the right place.
