# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a GitHub Pages repository for hosting a personal website at https://iamsajaad.github.io. The repository follows GitHub Pages conventions where content pushed to the main branch is automatically deployed.

## Development Workflow

Since this is a new repository, the technology stack and build process will be determined as the site is developed. Common approaches for GitHub Pages include:

- Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Jekyll (GitHub's default static site generator)
- React/Vue/Angular with build output
- Next.js, Gatsby, or other modern frameworks with static export

Once the technology stack is chosen, update this file with specific build and deployment commands.

## GitHub Pages Deployment

- **Deployment Branch**: main (or gh-pages, depending on repository settings)
- **Deployment URL**: https://iamsajaad.github.io
- Files are automatically published when pushed to the deployment branch
- The root index.html or framework output serves as the entry point

## Repository Structure

Update this section as the project structure is established. Typical structures include:

- Source files in root or `/src` directory
- Build output (if applicable) committed or generated via GitHub Actions
- Assets (images, fonts, etc.) in `/assets` or `/public` directory
- Configuration files in root directory
