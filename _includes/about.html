      <p class="about__label">Philosophy</p>
      <p>With 15+ years spanning e-commerce, mapping, logistics, and SaaS, I've led product at the scale of MENA's largest e-commerce platform and built my own ventures from scratch.</p>
      <p>My practice sits at the intersection of deep user research, business strategy, and hands-on technical execution. I've shipped products that captured 2% of all Iranian highway toll transactions, grew checkout conversions by 300%, and reduced bounce rates by 80% — not by following playbooks, but by spending time in the field and asking uncomfortable questions.</p>
      <p>I lead without authority. I build <em>with</em> engineers, not above them. And I believe the best product decisions come from the gap between what users say and what they actually do.</p>
