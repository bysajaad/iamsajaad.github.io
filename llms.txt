## About

Sajad Roudbari is a product designer, strategist, and leader based in the MENA region.
His work sits at the intersection of deep user research, business strategy, and hands-on
technical execution. He has shipped products at scale — including a platform that captured
2% of all Iranian highway toll transactions — and has grown checkout conversions by 300%
and reduced bounce rates by 80%.

He leads product teams without hierarchy, builds alongside engineers, and believes the best
product decisions emerge from the gap between what users say and what they actually do.
